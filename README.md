# Conway’s Game of Life

## Explanation

Conway’s Game of Life is not actually a game, but a cellular automaton. It consists of a grid containing “living” and “dead” cells. The number of living neighbouring cells determines whether a given cell will be alive in the next generation. You can read the exact rules on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
